# An Enhanced Vision Transformer with Autoencoder for Noise
Reduction in Knee X-raysThe model gave promising results, with Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0037, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0233, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0616, Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) of 0.9605, Peak Signal-to- Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.107, and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.8719. 

This project uses two datasets from Kaggle:
1. **Digital Knee X-ray Dataset**: Contains knee X-ray images for analysis.
2. **Knee Osteoarthritis Dataset**: Includes clinical data and severity labels for knee osteoarthritis. 

Both datasets are downloaded using the following commands:
1. !kaggle datasets download -d tommyngx/digital-knee-xray
2. !kaggle datasets download -d shashwatwork/knee-osteoarthritis-dataset-with-severity
